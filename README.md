### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ayenna (AH-ye-nuh)! This last fall I graduated from an accelerated 12 week fullstack software engineering program at Hackbright Academy. Prior to Hackbright, I worked research and communications roles in higher education and non profits. Most recently, I worked at CivicPulse as a research associate generating data-driven insights about local government. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio and a couple side projects. Check out:

- ðŸ§¹[ChoreBuddy](https://github.com/ayennac/proj-chores), a web app that uses the principles of body doubling and community to help users finish their chores

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Semantic UI and Django!
